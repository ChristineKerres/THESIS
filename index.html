            “Are we trapped in a flickering dream of infinite freedom within
            defined coordinates as an apathetic user dancing in between shiny
            gloom and glossy doom on the surface of a silent concept of arrogant
            machines*? ”<a href="#c001"><sup>1</sup></a>
          </p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the final question of the letter To the
          Apathetic User of Arrogant Machines, I aim to introduce my theoretical
          conception, let it to wander as a circulating thought across the
          following pages of my investigation, in order to finally revisit it
          again in the realm of my conceptual translation.
          <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Computer-aided machines create
          “framing” environments that can influence us as users. These
          environments are akin to spaces that, in their expansiveness,
          demonstrate boundaries and, in their form, impact the users. Within
          the context of programmed “spaces,” boundaries are not readily
          definable as enclosing walls or ceilings. Analogous to these
          physically tangible constraints, the boundaries of computer programs
          manifest in abstract-conceptual form as predetermined parameters of
          the software. Within this programmed “space,” the user interacts with
          the machine. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What influence does the
          conceptual “space design” of machines exert on users? How are the
          positions of humans and machines in their relationship to be
          described? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I aim to explore these questions
          in the theoretical analysis and, through engagement with the answers,
          lay the groundwork for the conception of my visual implentation. To
          this end, I initially focus on the notion of an architectural and
          mental space, aiming to establish an analogy to the conceptual-digital
          space. Subsequently, I will delve into the position and role of a user
          within the relational dynamic between human and machine, ultimately
          proposing a thesis that associatively illustrates this relationship.

            “The power of a ‘space’ lies in the possibilities it implies:
            immersion, habitation, ‘being-there,’ phenomenal plenitude,
            unmediated presence, all fall within its domain.”<a href="#c002"

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We enter, exit, or linger in spaces voluntarily or
          involuntarily, for a defined or undefined duration. Spaces are
          conceptual manifestations and can take on forms beyond architecturally
          functional building units, such as societal, mental, or technological
          environments. Tangible walls become invisible boundaries. However, the
          common characteristic of these spaces lies in establishing conditions
          with which we must engage when we enter them. Thus, we stand in a
          relational dynamic with them, rooted in the functions and mechanisms
          of these spaces, which can be either unilateral or mutual.
          <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout this chapter, I aim to
          comprehend spaces as concepts, examine them in various manifestations,
          and explore their influence on the bodies within them. <br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequently, I intend to expand this examination to the
          establishment of spaces by computer-aided machines, whose conceptual
          “space design” in the form of software influences us as users and
          provides a framework for our interaction with them.

          <p class="text-title">2.1 Body in space</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In general, a space relies on an architectural,
          geographical, political, or mathematical principle that is physically
          constraining in its extent or at least defined within its
          boundaries.<a href="#c003"><sup>3</sup></a>
          Most distinctly, a physical space can be described as a container that
          encloses content through walls, influencing its shape and connotation
          through these boundaries.
          <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This impact of its shape is also reflected
          in the principle espoused by Bruce Lee, although he doesn’t understand
          the formative influence in a physically tangible sense but as a mental
          concept. He employs allegory to elucidate his method in his methode of
          fighting in Martial Arts. Drawing from the philosophy of Wu-Wei, he
          describes, using the metaphor of “flexible” water, the principle of
          the natural flow of movement achieved through an adaptive response – a
          mental adjustment – to the respective situation in combat.<a href="#c004"><sup>4</sup></a>
          <p class="citation">
            “Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put
            water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle
            and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the
            teapot.” <a href="#c005"><sup>5</sup></a> – Bruce Lee
          </p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lee understands space as a psychological
          phenomenon, as a mental adaptation to new conditions arising from a
          situation. Metaphorically speaking, in this context, the situation -
          the water container - becomes the condition of the created space, to
          which a mental response is made - the adoption of the container’s
          shape.

          <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Limitations, like the walls of a
          vessel, are not obviously present, or physically identifiable, in the
          works of Alexander Calder’s Mobiles. Calder’s Mobiles are
          interconnected shapes, constructing delicate structures that are set
          in motion by external influences, such as drafts of air. The
          individual components are not a result of the conditions of the
          location in which they are exhibited. Their individual form exists
          prior to being placed in the environment. However, when placed in
          space, they are subject to the conditions of the location as a whole,
          continually redefining itself through the constant evolution of their
          composition. The relationship between space and object thus manifests
          itself in a mutual influence on appearance, as the changing shifts in
          the composition of Mobile redefine its surrounding in equal
          measure.<a href="#c006"><sup>6</sup></a> <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These two
          examples demonstrate that bodies and environments are in a
          relationship with each other. This relationship can be unilateral, as
          in Lee’s mental adaptation, or mutual, as in Calder’s Mobiles.
          Additionally, a space does not necessarily have to be physically
          tangible but can act as an influencing factor in a conceptual sense.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bruce Nauman examined spatial influence and its
          effects on the human body “[...] in order to acquire insights into the
          formative powers of normative structures and social patterns.”<a href="#c007"><sup
            >7</sup</a>
          >
          An example of his exploration is the piece Wall-Floor Positions, which
          he performed and filmed in his studio in 1968. In the 60-minute
          documentation of his performance, one can observe Nauman continuously
          shifting positions in relation to the spatial conditions of the walls
          and floor of his studio. In doing so, he illustrates the limitations
          and influences of the space on his body. His body becomes the fluid,
          moving part, while the space remains the conceptual construct.<a href="#c008"><sup

          </p>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp In both Wall-Floor Positions and other works like
          the series of Corridors installations, Nauman materializes the
          relationships between humans and their spatial surroundings. Through
          this, he aims to “[...] direct the experience of imposed postures to
          the visitors [...] that convey a tactile impression of the way
          constricting situations or environments have a psychological impact
          that manipulates human behavior.”<a href="#c009"><sup>9</sup></a> The recipient is
          confronted with questions that bring awareness to the physical
          positioning in space and the sensory perceptions within the created
          situation. Nauman calls for intellectual engagement with the present
          and the implicit characteristics of their absence.<a href="#c010"><sup>10</sup></a>
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbspIn summary, using Nauman’s example, the human body,
          as well as Lee’s or Calder’s object-like bodies, establish a
          relationship with their surrounding space. Bodies are influenced by
          spaces and can also influence the space. <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbspUsing this as a foundation, I now intend to
          incorporate the digitally programmed space as a conceptual framework
          of a computer program into the discussion and examine it in its
          design. This examination is an attempt to place the relationship
          between the user and the computer-mediated machine on a
          spatial-associative level, akin to Nauman, to compare the influence of
          conceptual considerations of spatial designs with the conceptual realm
          of software.

          <p class="text-title">2.2 Digital space</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A digital “space” of a computer-based application
          is free from physical restrictions; it is not bound by walls or
          ceilings. It is a “space” that, in its conception, creates an
          environment. The concept of this structure hovers as a framework over
          the whole and materializes as possibilities and their conditions. I
          would like to consider these conditions as equivalent to the walls of
          an architectural space. Consequently, “movement,” even if it may be
          digital, is influenced by the conditions programmed into the digital
          space. It is needless to say that these conditions must be agreed to,
          because “space” is a fixed concept that cannot be changed.
          <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though we do not physically enter this
          digital “space,” our movements are still dependent on its parameters.
          The principle of space and its influencing configuration is thus also
          found in software as a concept of the computer.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Media artist Jeffrey Shaw is considered a pioneer
          of interactive art and attempted to make immersive environments
          navigable and experiential with the body through his work Legible
          City. The installation consists of a folding bicycle and a cityscape
          represented in three-dimensional words projected onto a screen. These
          “primitive” virtual worlds can be "explored" by the viewer using the
          bicycle’s controls. However, the apparent self-determined navigation
          quickly gives way to critical comments from users. Florian Cramer, in
          “Exe.cut(up)able statements. Poetische Kalküle und Phantasmen des
          selbstausführenden Texts,” expresses that Legible City lacks the feel
          of a freely maneuverable environment where one’s movement is in sync
          with the depicted dynamics on the screen. The movement is “not
          spontaneous but part of a predetermined set of mathematical
          combinations”<a href="#c011"><sup>11</sup></a> and thus not a journey driven by the
          participants’ bodies, but rather an illusory-controllable, guided ride
          through the system.<a href="#c012"><sup>12</sup></a> He concludes, “The machine sets the
          framework for action, subjugates the recipient to its control, and

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The critique of Legible City is representative not
          only of this interactive art installation but also of the relationship
          and functioning of the human-machine relationship, and the portrayal
          of a superficial illusion of machine operations by concealing
          algorithmic structures.<a href="#c014"><sup>14</sup></a> <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;Shaw’s space installation is not the promised free space but an
          illusion and a “[...] structure of an artificial behaviorist system in
          which body and technology enter into a precarious relationship of
          mutual control. It is the machine that wins in this scenario because
          it dictates the framework of abstraction and cannot be reprogrammed by
          the cyclist. This artificial [...] [absurdity] characterizes not only
          Shaw’s work but the entire field of so-called ‘ interactive art,’
          which is based on a simplified, reductive understanding of interaction
          as cybernetic feedback and stimulus-response schemas, a behaviorism
          further restricted by machine algorithms hidden in black boxes.”<a href="#c015"><sup
            >15</sup
          ></a>
          <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The abstraction framework of the
          computer, as described by Florian Cramer, is a fixed construct that
          cannot be influenced or manipulated by the cyclist. The machine has
          control, and the participant is at the mercy of the inaccessibility of
          the automated mechanisms. In summary, one could say that the software
          of the application represents a restrictive, invisible, and
          unchangeable guidance of the user’s movements. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;On a conceptual level, Shaw’s Legible City resembles the
          artificial worlds of a video game and, in a broader sense, a digital
          space or software, which is a computer-aided machine. In the
          following, I would like to examine the concept of computer-aided
          machines more closely.

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The delimited space of interaction between the
          user and the machine is based on a computer program. Comparable to the
          boundaries or influencing factors of a physical space, the user is
          subject to the conditions of the program. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;Software, after all, are concepts that "come to life" in the
          execution of the code.<a href="#c016"><sup>16</sup></a>
          <p class="citation">
            “[...] [The] goal is to turn [...] code into an explicit list of
            instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates,
            thus turning [...] code into something that can be executed –
            software.”<a href="#c017"><sup>17</sup></a>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above all, as described in the last part of the

          the user interacts with it, firmly set in its execution, and immovable
          from the user’s perspective. The determinism of the program is the
          fundamental characteristic of the relationship between humans and
          machines, establishing clear power dynamics between the parties
          involved. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the following, I aim to focus
          on the concepts underlying these computer programs.

          <p class="text-title">3.1 Programmed to be arrogant</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In attempting to characterize digital machines,
          Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider juxtaposes humans as the reference
          point.
          <p class="citation">
            “Relative to men, computing machines are very fast and very
            accurate, but they are constrained to perform only one or a few
            elementary operations at a time. Men are flexible, capable of
            ‘programming themselves contingently’ on the basis of newly received
            information. Computing machines are single-minded, constrained by
            their ‘pre-programming.’ ”<a href="#c018"><sup>18</sup></a>
          </p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly, this observation should be understood
          within the temporal framework and context of technological progress in
          computers up to 1960. It’s undeniable that today’s computers far
          surpass the computational capabilities of those early machines,
          allowing them to handle not only simple tasks but also a multitude of
          processes simultaneously. However, Licklider’s conclusion,
          particularly in his conceptual portrayal, points to an intriguing
          perspective. <br /><br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point, I’d like to take a look back at
          the history of computer-assisted processes, which can be traced back
          to the development of the automated loom by Joseph Marie Jacquard in
          the early 19th century. The control of the loom was achieved through
          hardware-level mechanisms. Using punched cards, the loom encoded the
          holes in the cards into movements of machine’s components, resulting
          in patterns in the textiles. This step of automation sparked outrage
          and led to revolts, as workers realized they were no longer in full
          control of their work processes. <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the 1930s, the control of automated processes
          shifted from hardware to software, albeit initially on an abstract
          level through Alan Turing’s mathematical model (Turing machine).
          <br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we can observe in current computer technology,
          over the subsequent years, this fundamental model of controlling and
          executing computational and command processes has been expanded. The
          integration of data processing, for example, through sensors
          (data-driven), as well as the ability to react to events
          (event-driven), has made the system significantly more flexible and
          dynamic.<a href="#c019"><sup>19</sup></a>

        <div id="007">
          <p class="text-title">3.2 Code as choreography</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against this backdrop, Licklider’s
          characterization of the machine as a "single-minded creature," whose
          inherent concept (software) limits its capabilities, is a relevant
          notion. History demonstrates that machines have always been subject to
          a concept that has only evolved in complexity over time. <br />&nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; This idea is echoed in Alexander R. Galloway’s
          discourse, where he no longer draws comparisons to humans but instead
          relies on the principles of conceptual art, specifically those of Sol
          LeWitt.
          <p class="citation">
            “In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect
            of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means
            that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the
            execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that
            makes the art.” <a href="#c020"><sup>20</sup></a> – Sol LeWitt
          </p>
          With this definition outline, Galloway emphasizes his notion that the
          idea becomes the machine. Programming brings the concept to life, and
          the machine is in control of executing its concept at the moment of
          work.<a href="#c021"><sup>21</sup></a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Galloway further observes
          that “LeWitt’s art is an algorithmic process. The algorithm is
          prepared in advance, and then later executed by the artist (or another
          artist, for that matter).” <a href="#c022"><sup>22</sup></a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The
          necessity for the software concept to exist before execution lies in
          the specificity of the language of the machine, as expressed by
          Friedrich Kittler in the following words:
          <p class="citation">
            “Code is a language, but a very special kind of language. Code is
            the only language that is executable. [...] ‘[t]here exists no word
            in any ordinary language which does what is says. No description of
            a machine sets the machine into motion.’ <a href="#c023"><sup>23</sup></a> So code is
            the first language that actually does what is says – it is a machine
            for converting meaning into action.”<a href="#c024"><sup>24</sup></a>
          </p>
          Software is a language of direct impact that implements the concept at
          the moment of code execution. Consequently, the existence of the
          concept before its execution is assumed. In this regard, I would like
          to highlight Licklider once again, who illustrates the difficulties of
          this language and implicitly acknowledges the responsibility of
          programmers. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He describes that the
          preformulation of problems requires that“[...] all the alternatives
          must be foreseen in advance.”<a href="#c025"><sup>25</sup></a> This has significant
          consequences because “[i]f an unforeseen alternative arises,the whole
          process comes to a halt and awaits the necessary extension of the
          program.”<a href="#c026"><sup>26</sup></a> However, predicting all possibilities and
          integrating an appropriate response into the software is simply
          impossible.<a href="#c027"><sup>27</sup></a> <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the
          comparisons and arguments presented show, a computer is, in its
          programming, a rigid concept, whose framing scope defines the
          preconceived possibilities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The central
          question now concerns the distribution of roles in the relationship
          between the computer and the users, as well as the implications of
          this system on usage.

          <p class="text-title">3.3 Veiled in complexity</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is evident that the computer can have a
          significant impact on its users, even if this is not immediately
          apparent. One reason for this lies in the inaccessibility of the
          structures and operations of these systems. For most people, what
          happens behind the screen interface is not necessarily clear. The
          cause is not disinterest but rather the complexity and opacity of this
          technology, which may exceed the scope of understanding for many.
          <p class="citation">
            “If you open a computer or a computer toy, you see no gears that
            turn, no levers that move, no tubes that glow. Most often, you see
            some wires and one black chip. [...] [T]he physical opacity of this

          </p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is difficult to explain how non-physical,
          tangible things work. However, characterizing them in human-like terms
          is more straightforward, and attributing characteristics that ascribe
          free will or intelligence to computers is plausible. <a href="#c029"><sup>29</sup></a> To
          exaggerate slightly, one might ask whether the consequences of this
          opacity are akin to surrendering to the workings of computers. Whether
          the difficulty of access leads to a passive stance or even resignation
          towards computer-assisted processes. Above all, there’s a danger that
          invisibility may lead to misunderstanding the influence of a
          programmed environment and its predetermined parameters, as well as
          its impact on the framework of interaction.

          <p class="text-title">4.1 How to become a user?</p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the German language, the interaction of a user
          is limited to a computerized space because, by definition, a user is a
          “[...] person who uses a computer.”<a href="#c030"><sup>30</sup></a>. However, in English,
          the word is used in a broader context. Here, a user is a person who
          uses a product or a machine or avails themselves of a
          service.<a href="#c031"><sup>31</sup></a>.
          <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most well-known and perhaps the first
          official user of an interactive computer system is the engineer
          Douglas Engelbart, who presented a usable system called the oN-Line
          System (NLS) at the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) on December 9,
          1968. In a carefully crafted demonstration, famously known as "The
          Mother of All Demos," he showcased a system distinguished by its
          hardware and software configurations. Remarkably, the presentation
          highlighted interaction possibilities via a computer mouse, keyboard,
          and screen connected to the computer, which are considered pioneering
          in the operation of modern operating systems.<a href="#c032"><sup>32</sup></a>

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the time of the introduction of the new system,
          future users were skeptical, describing it as “[…] complicated, hard
          to learn, poorly documented […]”<a href="#c033"><sup>33</sup></a>. From today’s
          perspective, we understand that it is only a matter of time until the
          “[…] right human […] [ is found, one who adapts to] the new artifact
          and methodology of operation […]”<a href="#c034"><sup>34</sup></a> and feels comfortable
          in their newfound role as a user.<a href="#c035"><sup>35</sup></a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
          &nbsp;There is no trace today of the hesitant mood surrounding the new
          possibilities from back then, which is likely also due to the
          scientific examination of cognitive processes, making the operation of
          the system increasingly intuitive. In 1971, Allen Newell, a US
          computer scientist and cognitive psychologist, expressed this
          sentiment with the following words.<a href="#c036"><sup>36</sup></a>
          <p class="citation">
            “There is emerging a psychology of cognitive behavior that will
            permit calculation of behavior in new situations and with new
            humans…” <a href="#c037"><sup>37</sup></a>
          </p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Newell is likely referring to our generation,
          which, thanks to Cognitive Engineering or User-Centered Design, has no
          qualms about communicating through a Human-Computer Interface (HCI).
          Today, this comes as naturally as if being a user were practically
          ingrained from birth.

          in common.”<a href="#c038"><sup>38</sup></a> In the field of computer technology, the term

          objects. An interface is therefore essential An interface is therefore
          essential for the usability of computers <a href="#c039"><sup>39</sup></a> and “ [...]

          the context of the user as a user of the system, the term User
          Interface (UI) is introduced. In addition to interaction possibilities
          through keyboard, mouse, and other hardware components, the screen
          surface is perhaps the most important interaction interface and is
          transformed into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) through its
          design.<a href="#c041"><sup>41</sup></a> <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the
          development of new technologies and increasingly smarter user
          interfaces, as heralded by the release of the iPhone by Apple in the
          late 2000s, computer usage has become more complex. Screens are no
          longer just control surfaces; they are equipped with sensory
          systems<a href="#c042"><sup>42</sup></a> and can now “[...] gaze back at the viewer,
          respond to his or her touch, heartbeat, and position in space
          [...]”.<a href="#c043"><sup>43</sup></a> The possibilities for us, as well as the spectrum
          of different user data and processing capabilities, have increased.
          Consequently, the conditions in which we control our bodies through
          this new reality, or are controlled by it, have expanded.<a href="#c044"><sup>44</sup></a>
          <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The necessity of this interface – the
          Human-Computer Interface – in the complex relationship between humans
          and computers is therefore to be viewed as an essential communication
          foundation for both sides. Designing the Human-Computer Interface is
          of crucial importance and is manifested in conceptual-technical and

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drawing on the visual metaphor depicted above, I
            aim to elucidate the relationship between humans and machines. In
            this illustration, the sturdy wooden post represents the users,
            while the fan symbolizes the entirety of computerized technology.
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The initially harmonious stability quickly
            gives way to questions about the concessions made by both parties.
            It’s evident that these limitations are primarily attributed to the
            users, whose form had to accommodate a cutout, which, without the
            machine, would leave an unfilled gap. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp;Metaphorically, this illustration depicts the omnipresence and
            intertwining of machines in the life of a user. However, it also
            raises two questions: Who depends on whom? And who existed before
            whom? <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the latter question may
            seem self-evident in its banality – as from an evolutionary
            perspective, the existence of users predates that of machines and
            plays an essential role in the stability of the space – the
            juxtaposition of the two elements in the space raises legitimate
            doubts about this explanation. The image suggests that the fan must
            have existed before the wooden post (or the idea of the machine
            before the emergence of users) because the wooden post has adapted
            its position to accommodate the fan through the cutout. By
            positioning humans as users at the beginning of the causal chain,
            one ignores the fact that humans can only be designated as users
            through the machine. In other words, the concept of the machine
            turns humans into users. However, it overlooks the fact that the
            machine could not have come into existence without the ideation of
            users. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The question of who existed
            before whom, or who found their position through whom, defies a
            straightforward answer. Nevertheless, the equilibrium of this
            relationship appears undeniable, yet it remains open which side had
            to make compromises and which side holds the upper hand in this
            relationship. Insight into the positions of this relationship will
            be provided by the subsequent analysis of the concept of interaction
            in computer science compared to its use in the field of sociology.

            <p class="text-title">5.2 Interaction ≠ Interaction</p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interaction is the driving force in the
            human-computer relationship. As a computer-operating organism, the
            human being falls into a subjectless process whose interaction is
            subordinated to the machine’s preconditions.<a href="#c054"><sup>54</sup></a>
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication with the system of a machine
            is manifested, for example, through the “[…] user activity of mouse
            clicks, [as] the technological act of triggering various program
            parameters within a cybernetic feedback loop,”<a href="#c055"><sup>55</sup></a> and is
            distinguished from interpersonal interaction, an interpretative
            stimulus-response model in the sociological sense. The difference
            lies in the positions of the participants. In the communication
            between humans and computers, there is no mutual interpretation.
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The confusion over the meaning of the
            term "interaction" stems from its parallel emergence and usage in
            computer science and sociology in the early twentieth century.
            Nevertheless, the meaning of the term in the two contexts is
            interesting because the interpretive level, a fundamental
            characteristic of interaction between humans, is absent in the
            interaction between humans and computers. The positions of the
            relationship become clearer in this comparative analysis.
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The computer is interactive, and humans
            interact.<a href="#c056"><sup>56</sup></a> Hence, misunderstandings on the part of
            machines are not possible; there are only clear requests from the
            user to the computer system.

            <p class="citation">
              Concerns are expressed with the following words: “Instead of
              simplifying or solving problems, computers may have brought on
              addictive overwork and automated joblessness. Rather than increas

            <p class="text-title">5.4 The utopia of Man-Computer Symbiosis</p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In conclusion, describing this relationship is
            an abstract matter and requires consideration from various
            perspectives. Therefore, I would like to conclude by mentioning
            Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, who spoke about a vision of a more
            harmonious relationship between humans and machines, albeit one with
            its own set of challenges. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            Licklider outlined his vision of "Man-Computer Symbiosis" in 1960,
            envisioning a future where machines become close cooperative
            partners whose function is,<a href="#c061"><sup>61</sup></a> “[…] to enable men and
            computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex
            situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined
            programs.”<a href="#c062"><sup>62</sup></a> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is worth noting
            that the development of computers towards massive data storage,
            processing, and distribution, as we know it today, was not yet a
            reality when these considerations were made. However, some aspects
            of Licklider’s vision may have come to fruition. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp;Yet, one must question whether a stable equilibrium of
            symbiotic coexistence between computers and humans is realistic and
            whether the concept of symbiosis adequately embodies Licklider’s
            vision. While cooperative collaboration may resemble the principle
            of symbiosis, the notion of a relationship being concept-independent
            is not met. The user is inevitably bound to the machine’s concept.
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is a concept-independent system even
            possible when computers are determined by their functionality and
            dictate the framework of possibilities? As explored in the chapter
            on 3.2 Code as Choreography, computers always operate on the
            principle of processing “[…] preformulated problems or to process
            data according to predetermined procedures.”<a href="#c063"><sup>63</sup></a> Therefore,
            all aspects of the system are defined, and all alternatives are
            considered in advance.<a href="#c064"><sup>64</sup></a>

            question arises: What is the origin of this relationship, and why
            does the seemingly insurmountable dependence of users on computers
            persist? The following concluding reflection aims to explore these
            questions and serves as a final evaluation of the discussions
            already addressed.

              of nature, which is so omnipresent that we dare not question its
              existence.
            </p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A central cause of this passivity lies in the
            invisibility of computer-based technologies due to their
            omnipresence. We can “[...] no longer think of technologies as
            objects that are seperate from subjects. Our being-in-the-world is
            itself a fact that is technologycally produced, and our ability to
            perceive, formerly one with natural procedure, depends on the
            apparatus of the technological system in which we live.”
            <a href="#c066"><sup>66</sup></a> Technologien sind viel zu verzweigt mit unserem Leben,
            sodass eine Abkehr nicht mehr möglich scheint. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp;This omnipresence is further complemented by the principles of
            User Experience Design, which contribute to redering the interfaces
            between machine and human increasingly invisible through ever more
            intuitive operation. Tailored to individual users with personalized
            configurations, the goals of the user-centric perspective play a
            crucial role in emotionally approaching the technical device.
            Computers become familiar partners and hide the lack of
            understanding of the mechanisms running in the background. What
            remains invisible is the concept of the computer program with its
            pre-formulated interaction possibilities and conditions.
            <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, it is evident that
            the omnipresence of machines, the invisibility of intuitive
            interaction, the fascination for technical functions, and the lack
            of understanding of machine mechanisms are the causes of user
            passivity, which fuels dependence on computer-based machines and
            maintains the balance of the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp;However, recognizing these established norms of computer-based
            machines and understanding their functions, including their limits
            and influences on their users, can be an exciting starting point for
            experiments at the limits of possibilities and the repurposing or
            redesign of these applications.

            <p class="text-title">7.3 Challenge and goal</p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The relationship between humans and machines is
            to be considered based on a conceptual framework that emerges from
            the idea and design of the digital machine, and is manifested in the
            execution of the software and user interaction. Upon entering this
            “space,” i.e., the beginning of interaction with the machine, a user
            adapts to these conceptual conditions. Metaphorically speaking, the
            user becomes a choreographed dancer. These conceptual conditions or
            choreography are determined by the nature of computer program code,
            whose framing determinism does not allow for ambiguous
            interpretation in interaction and is not changeable in form.
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ubiquity of computer-driven machines,
            intuitive interaction through user-centric design, fascination with
            technological advancement, and the inscrutable complexity of
            computers result in passivity and unconscious acceptance of the role
            of the user in the human-machine system. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I
            want to illustrate the described finding with a conclusion. Software
            concepts create inflexible conditions in which users become
            apathetic participants of the system, and machines become "arrogant"
            instructors. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, I do not wish
            to condemn the use of computer-driven technologies or call for their
            rejection. Rather, the aim is to raise awareness about the passivity
            of users, which prevents questioning the relationship with computers
            and looking beyond the user interface.

            <p class="text-title">7.4 Title</p>
            “... Dancing in between Shiny Gloom and Glossy Doom ...”, serves
            both as the title of my work and, in its complete form, as the
            concluding question in the letter “To the Apathetic User of Arrogant
            Machines.” <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taken out of context, I aim to
            create an associative space for viewers that holds significance
            derived from the theoretical exploration and finds expression in the
            letter. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The meaning of the first
            part of the sentence, dancing in between, remains open-ended. It
            raises questions about who the dancer is and whether this dance is
            freestyle or subject to choreography. Through the course of the
            discussion, it becomes clear that the dancer represents the user,
            who is choreographed by the concept of the machine. <br />&nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp;The second part of the sentence highlights the user’s
            hopeless situation. The use of shiny gloom and glossy doom embodies
            the endless dance in an undefined space between two states. In the
            context of the discussion, these terms serve as references to the
            acceptance or rejection of computer-driven technology. The tautology
            of the two words signifies that no decision is necessary, pointing
            to the omnipresence of technology and the impossibility of negating
            it. The accompanying adjectives shiny and glossy emphasize the
            user’s blind unconsciousness and superficial perception of machines.
            Thus, the second part of the title portrays the user’s hopeless
            situation in their interaction with a machine.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In search of an adequate and tangible visual
            translation of my metaphor, I found inspiration in the structure and
            principle of a rotisserie grill. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The
            construction embodies both the metaphorical examination of the
            relationship between machine and human, as well as the naive
            encounter of the latter, which turns them into choreographed
            dancers. In this visual translation, the users become the chickens,
            the grill represents the spatial construction of the machine, and
            the movement symbolizes the concept of the program (software). The
            continuous rotation of the chickens around their own axis plays an
            essential role. It embodies the passive helplessness and accepted
            fate of the users towards the rigid space formed by the machine.
            Their movement is choreographed, as the chickens, or rather the
            users, do not move independently within the system; they are moved
            in a predetermined direction dictated by the machine.

            <p class="image-text-source">Final sketch</p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The installation comprises a metallic structure
            composed of elements inspired by the analysis of the components of a
            rotisserie grill. The central components are the two vertically
            offset rotisserie spits, rotating continuously at a moderate speed
            around their own axis. Attached to these horizontally rotating spits
            are two computers each, facing away from each other. They are
            mounted slightly below and above eye level on the structure.
            Following the model, the construction is made of metal pipes and
            sheets. The framing apparatus suggests the cold, lifeless character
            of a massive machine entity due to the material properties and the
            two-meter height. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the fabrication of
            the framing structure, I used three-centimeter-wide square tubes to
            visually counterbalance the massive character of the computer
            construction. Additionally, I removed the dark mill scale from the
            steel material to achieve a glossy surface. The side panels, with
            one angled leg each and a staggered arrangement, create a
            space-expanding effect and enhance the overall stability of the
            construction. For the rotating computers, I utilized motorized
            rotisserie spits attached between two housings each. The use of two
            rotisserie spits and four computers in total reinforces the analogy
            to the arrangement of chickens in a grill device. A slip ring on the
            sides of the structure allows for power supply to the computers and
            simultaneous rotation of these units through the motors.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The letter serves as a call to action for the
            user and encompasses both the content and conceptual aspects of the
            installation. Structured as a thought experiment, it consists of
            five sections, each starting with a description of the relationship
            between the user and the machine, accompanied by a thought-provoking
            question. The letter is provided with the installation in analog
            form and sticks to a metal plate saturated in grease as a reference
            to the rotisserie chicken. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The design
            mirrors the movement of the computers within the framing structure,
            capturing their continuous rotation around their own axis. Reading
            the letter requires constant rotation to the front and back of the
            letter. To emphasize this manipulated, compulsive movement, subtle
            clues are integrated into the design. A directional arrow on the
            front indicates the reading direction and signifies the start of the
            text flow. Additionally, a lightweight paper with a grammage of
            60gsm hints at the existence of text on the reverse side. The text
            is slightly angled on the paper to guide the reader to the
            corresponding text flow on the back. Furthermore, the last letters
            at the edges of the paper are tilted towards the paper’s edge,
            emphasizing the importance of the paper’s margin.

            <p class="text-title">7.5.4 Computer displays</p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within the construction, four computers are
            mounted on two skewers each, positioned within the structure
            resembling the arrangement of skewered chickens. Positioned on two
            staggered levels, the computers are attached to motorized skewers
            facing away from each other. They rotate horizontally around their
            own axes. Unlike conventional setups where screens face the user,
            here their orientation is determined by the rotation, presenting
            varied angles to the viewer. To perceive the displayed content,
            exhibition visitors are encouraged to follow a predefined movement,
            either approaching the screens or tracking their rotational motion.
            <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The computer displays continuously
            alternate between different screen brightness levels, producing a
            rhythmic flickering visible on the monitors, as dictated by a
            scripted sequence. This illustrates the first part of the letter,
            suggesting that we, as computer users, are drawn to the glow of
            screens like moths, remaining apathetic in their presence. In line
            with this premise, exhibition visitors are captivated by the
            flickering of the computer screens, intensified by the dimly lit
            room. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through interaction by
            touching the computer screens, visitors can transition into users
            and discover the visual reference. Upon touch, a rotating grilled
            chicken appears on the display, being roasted in a grill device. The
            text line “choreographed by machines,”fully readable only upon
            touching the two staggered screens, prompts further interpretation
            of the artwork for the visitor.

          website accessible via a QR code, serves as a kind of informative
          guide and can be regarded as a reference to machine manuals.
          <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The README provides background information
          on the project's thesis conception, insights into the underlying
          associations of the installation’s concept, as well as a brief guide
          for reading the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The design of
          the README also adheres to the principles of the installation. The
          website begins with a flickering screen, mirroring the visual
          experience on the monitors of the computers within the construction.
          Clicking on the screen leads to the subpage with relevant exhibition
          background information and instructions. However, to read the page’s
          content, it is necessary to initially rotate the smartphone upside
          down, as the text is displayed mirrored in its normal position. This
          action once again prompts user engagement. Only by following the
          predetermined movement of the smartphone will the content become
          legible. <br /><br />

          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The construction and the letter form an
          integrated installation unit, complemented by the use of oil, which
          serves associatively as a unifying element visible directly or
          indirectly in every part of the installation. It indirectly appears in
          the depiction of the grilled chicken on the computer display and is
          employed in fixing the letter to the metal surface as a means of
          attachment. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within the exhibition
          context, the construction occupies a darkened space, allowing the
          brightness of the screens to become the sole source of illumination,
          drawing visitors' attention. Positioned freely within the room to
          enable access from all sides, the construction invites visitors to
          engage with it actively. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As visitors
          observe the rotating monitors in the installation, read the letter,
          and utilize the README webpage, they are prompted to be guided by the
          prescribed movements, offering them a firsthand experience of the
          work’s concept.
